 # Flask App with MySQL Docker Setup

This is a simple Flask app that interacts with a MySQL database. The app allows users to submit messages, which are then stored in the database and displayed on the frontend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## To run this two-tier application using  without docker-compose

- First create a docker image from Dockerfile
```bash
docker build -t flaskapp .
```

- Now, make sure that you have created a network using following command
```bash
docker network create twotier
```

- Attach both the containers in the same network, so that they can communicate with each other

i) MySQL container 
```bash
docker run -d \
    --name mysql \
    -v mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql \
    --network=twotier \
    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb \
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=admin \
    -p 3306:3306 \
    mysql:5.7

```
ii) Backend container
```bash
docker run -d \
    --name f1-app \
    --network=twotier \
    -e MYSQL_HOST=mysql \
    -e MYSQL_USER=root \
    -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=admin \
    -e MYSQL_DB=mydb \
    -p 5000:5000 \
    f1app:latest

```

## Notes

- Make sure to replace placeholders (e.g., `your_username`, `your_password`, `your_database`) with your actual MySQL configuration.

- This is a basic setup for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you should follow best practices for security and performance.
